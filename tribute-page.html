            <p>Togo was one of the descendants of the former lead dog, Suggen. It was named after the Japanese admiral Tōgō Heihachirō. After only a few weeks as a house pet, Togo jumped through a closed window pane and ran several miles back to his master's original kennel. This devotion to the team impressed Seppala, so he did not try to give it away again. However, Togo continued to cause trouble coming out of the kennel when Seppala took the team out for a run.  <br> <br>Togo began training, and after a few years he took the position of guide dog. He became one of Seppala's most prized dogs, a close and mutually beneficial relationship that would continue to the end of Togo's life. <br><br>The National Park Service notes that in 1960, Seppala said, "I never had a better dog than Togo. His stamina, loyalty, and intelligence could not be bettered. Togo was the best dog that ever walked the Alaskan Trail." <br <br>Seppala sled dogs were kept for many years, but have recently become a rare breed. The current breeder has decided to stop working on them, as people do not recognize them. Also, those who buy them cross them with modern sled dogs, thus losing the main idea of ​​having a pure-bred Seppala sled dog. <br> <br>
